# Report on the Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting whether funding applicants are likely to be successful in their ventures. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model aims to assist Alphabet Soup in identifying organizations that have the best chance of utilizing funding effectively.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- **Target Variable**:  
  The target variable for the model is the `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column, which indicates whether the funding was used effectively.
- **Feature Variables**:  
  All other columns from the dataset were used as features, excluding `IS_SUCCESSFUL`.
- **Removed Variables**:  
  The columns `EIN` and `NAME` were removed because they are identifiers and do not provide meaningful input for predicting success.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- **Model Architecture**:  
  - Two hidden layers:
    - First layer: 8 neurons.
    - Second layer: 5 neurons.
  - Activation functions: Initially chosen as a starting point for experimentation.
- **Model Performance**:  
  The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 73%, below the target of 75%.
- **Optimization Steps**:  
  - Added more layers.
  - Removed additional columns.
  - Increased hidden nodes.
  - Experimented with activation functions.

### Summary
- **Overall Accuracy**: ~73%.
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Additional data cleaning to reduce noise.
  2. Explore alternative models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees.
  3. Iterative refinements to the neural network.
